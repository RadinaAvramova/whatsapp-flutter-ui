4. **Status Updates:** Enables users to view status updates from contacts, including text, images, and videos.

5. **Calls:** Displays a call history with contacts, allowing users to view call logs and make calls directly from the application.

6. **Profile Settings:** Allows users to access and modify their profile settings, including profile picture, status message, and privacy settings.
